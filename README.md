# Customer_Behaviour_Analysis
Data analytics project showing the Customer_Behaviour_Analysis Using Python, SQl and PowerBI.
📊 Data Analytics Project
🔹 Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow starting from raw data to actionable insights.
The pipeline includes data loading using Python, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, SQL querying across multiple databases, dashboard creation in Power BI, and final presentation of insights through a report and presentation.

The goal is to showcase practical skills in data analysis, database querying, and business intelligence reporting.

🔹 Dataset
